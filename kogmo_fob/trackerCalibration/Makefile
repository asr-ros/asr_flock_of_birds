# TARGET: Put the name of the final executable here.
# You can build a shared library by making this end in ".so" or a
# static library by making it end in ".a". In that case, MAIN_OBJS are
# ignored!
TARGET=trackerCalibration

# TOPDIR: Put the path to the toplevel project here, if this is a
# subproject. Emacs does this automatically for you. The path is best
# expressed as combination of ".."'s, since then you can move the
# whole directory tree.

# Object file specifications:
#         "What things that I have written go into the program?"

# MAIN_OBJS: Contains the main C/C++ file(s). Only used if you're not
# building a library!
MAIN_OBJS=Main

# TESTABLE_OBJS: All C/C++ files that contain a test block. Usually,
# this means at least all files auto-generated by Emacs. Every XXX
# that is listed here can be made into a standalone testable program
# by typing "make XXX_test".

# GENERAL_OBJS: Everything else.

# IDL_FILES: Put CORBA IDL files your program depends upon here. They

# MOC_FILES: Put Qt .moc files your program depends upon here. They

# SUBPROJECTS_BEFORE: If this project contains any directories that
# are projects in themselves, put them here. These will be built
# BEFORE this project is built. Use that for libraries etc. that this
# project depends on.
# Note: You can also define the variable SUBPROJECTS, which does the
# same as this one -- the _BEFORE suffix is just for clarity, to make
# immediately obvious exactly at what time a subproject is built.

# SUBPROJECTS_AFTER: If this project contains any directories that are
# projects in themselves, put them here. These will be built AFTER
# this project is built. Use that for tools etc. that use this project
# as a library.

# BGTOOLSDIR: Points to the directory where bgtools resides on your
# machine. You really shouldn't need to change this.
